## Migration Process and Test Execution Steps

1. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to the GitHub website (https://github.com)
   - Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner and select "New repository"
   - Enter a name for the new repository (e.g., "webdriverio_migration")
   - Optionally, provide a description for the repository
   - Choose the repository visibility (public or private)
   - Click on the "Create repository" button

2. Initialize a local Git repository:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt
   - Navigate to the root folder of the converted code
   - Run the command `git init` to initialize a new Git repository

3. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   - Copy the URL of the newly created GitHub repository (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/webdriverio_migration.git)
   - Run the command `git remote add origin <repository-url>` to add the GitHub repository as a remote (replace `<repository-url>` with the copied URL)

4. Commit and push the converted code:
   - Run the command `git add .` to stage all the changes
   - Run the command `git commit -m "Initial migration"` to commit the changes with a meaningful message
   - Run the command `git push -u origin migration-process` to push the changes to the GitHub repository (replace `migration-process` with the branch name)

5. Create documentation outlining the migration process and steps for running the new tests:
   - Create a new file in the root folder of the repository (e.g., "migration_documentation.md")
   - Write detailed instructions on how to perform the migration, including the steps taken, any modifications made, and any challenges faced
   - Include clear instructions on how to run the new tests using WebdriverIO
   - Commit and push the documentation file to the GitHub repository
